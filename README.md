# Su-Tic-Tac-Toe

## Rules:
<ul>
  <li>Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board.</li>
  <li>The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location.</li>
  <li>If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then it wins that local board.</li>
  <li>Once the outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw), no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board. âšª Game play ends when either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.</li>
</ul>

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
